# Hospital Management System 

<br>

You can watch the full presentation of our project which is mainly focused on the design of the database by clicking [here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfWCqz8Vvac)

<br>

As a team of 5 students, we gathered a huge variety of information by researching then created a single table with some fake personas to imitate a functioning hospital. After that, we pinpointed the attributes that should be primary/secondary keys. Finally, we formed a 3NF relational database from scratch by writing the SQL queries that we wrote and run on the MySQL server.

1. [Creating the UNF table](sql-queries/creating-the-unf-table.md)
2. [Forming 3NF tables from the UNF table](sql-queries/creating-3nf-tables-from-the-unf.md)
3. [Creating view of Patient Records by joining every table](sql-queries/view-of-patient-records.md)
