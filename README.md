# Hospital Management System 

<br>

As a team of 5 students, we gathered a huge variety of information by researching then created a single table with some fake personas to imitate a functioning hospital. After that, we pinpointed the attributes that should be primary/secondary keys. Finally, we formed a 3NF relational database from scratch by writing the SQL queries that we wrote and run on the MySQL server.
