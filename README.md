# Hospital Management System Database

<p>We as a team of 5 students gathered a huge variety of information from the real-world documents by researching. Then we created our own document with some fake personas to imitate a functioning hospital. After that, we pinpointed the attributes that has a potential of having primary/secondary keys. From that we formed a 3NF relational database from scratch using necessary sql queries that we wrote on MySQL server.</p>
